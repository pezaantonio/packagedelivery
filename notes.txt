row is source
column is destination

make a dict for the addresses
key = address
value = index (of row/column)

empty cells in distance data

distance lookup function(sourceAddress, destAddress):
    sourceAddress = [x]
    destAddress = [y]
    return [x][y]

if row value > column value
    swap the two

unit test the package lookup function

nearest neighbor algorithm
sort by distance, find the smallest distance and go there

step 1:
load the trucks
step 2:
delivery algorithm comes into play when trucks leave the depot
